# lita-crazycaps

**lita-crazycaps** is a terrible handler for [Lita](https://github.com/jimmycuadra/lita) that should never be used unless you want to annoy everyone at all times. If you're enough of a fool to want to garner ill will from your fellow chatters, then this will take a phrase and randomly alternate its characters' capitalization so it comes out looking like garbage.

## Installation

Add lita-crazycaps to your Lita instance's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem "lita-crazycaps"
```

## Usage

To make your phrase's capitalization crazy:

```
 [You] Lita: crazycaps "This is intelligible text right here, yo"
[Lita] "tHIs Is inTeLliGIblE TExT RigHt HeRe, yO"
